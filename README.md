# Customer Churn & CLV Prediction — End-to-End MLOps Pipeline

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict **customer churn** and compute **risk-adjusted Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**.

It covers the full lifecycle:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Model training with XGBoost  
- Experiment tracking with MLflow  
- Inference service using FastAPI  
- Containerization with Docker  

This project demonstrates real-world **MLOps practices**.
